week and hour of the day?

activity?

Data Cleaning and Transformation:

1. Data Import: Imported the retail sales data into Excel.

2. Data Cleaning: Cleaned the data to remove any inconsistencies or errors, such as missing values or incorrect data types.

3. Data Modeling: Used Power Query to transform the data, including creating calculated columns and aggregating data to answer specific questions.



Dashboard Creation:

1. Sales by Day and Hour: Analyzed sales variation by day of the week and hour of the day to identify peak times for sales activity and visualized this information using charts or graphs.

2. Total Sales Revenue by Month: Calculated the total sales revenue for each month and presented it graphically to identify trends over time.

3. Sales Variation Across Locations: Examined how sales vary across different store locations and visualized this information to compare performance.

4. Average Price/Order per Person: Calculate the average price per order and person to understand spending patterns.

5. Best-Selling Products: Identified the best-selling products in terms of quantity and revenue and visualized this information to highlight popular items.

6. Sales by Product Category and Type: Analyzed sales variation by product category and type to understand customer preferences and behavior.



Insights and Recommendations:

Based on the analysis conducted and insights gained from the dashboard, I can provide actionable recommendations to help the coffee shop's performance. For example:

- Schedule staffing levels according to peak sales times to improve customer service.

- Offer promotions or discounts on popular products to boost sales revenue.

- Consider expanding product offerings or adjusting pricing strategies based on customer preferences.



Next Steps:

Continuously monitor sales data and update the dashboard regularly to track performance trends and identify opportunities for improvement. Additionally, consider incorporating predictive analytics or forecasting models to anticipate future sales trends and make proactive decisions.
